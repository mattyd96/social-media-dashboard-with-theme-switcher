## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I was able to experiment with some flexbox properties which were quite interesting such as grow and shrink. Using css variables to easily change colour schemes with JavaScript was also a very useful thing to learn.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on using flex to scale pages as they are resized. I ended up not using flex and grow for this particular project and kept the modules a constant size but I can see where the flex and grow can be very useful.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp](w3schools Toggle Switch) - This helped me to create the slider toggle. It is a good starting point for anyone needing one. Although I did find some open source ones that might be useful for other projects in the following link
- [https://freefrontend.com/css-toggle-switches/](https://freefrontend.com/css-toggle-switches/) - This sote in general is a great resource and I will be using it in the future
